# Employee-Tracker

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


    The command-line application should allow users to:

        Add departments, roles, employees

        View departments, roles, employees

        Update employee roles
        
 This CLI app uses MYSQL to be able to accomplish the above tasks
